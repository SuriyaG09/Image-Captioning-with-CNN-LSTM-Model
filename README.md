# Image-Captioning-with-CNN-LSTM-Model
This repository contains an implementation of an image captioning system using a CNN-LSTM model. The system generates descriptive captions for input images, combining visual features extracted by a pre-trained CNN (such as VGG16) with textual features modeled by an LSTM network

Key Features:

Integration of a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) for image feature extraction.
Utilization of an LSTM network for sequence modeling and caption generation.
Text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization and cleaning, to enhance the quality of the input captions.
Fusion of visual and textual features to generate contextually relevant captions.
Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics to optimize and assess the performance of the model.
Compatibility with popular deep learning frameworks -- TensorFlow .
Demo notebooks and example code to facilitate understanding and usage.
Dataset:
The model can be trained and evaluated using standard image captioning datasets such as Flicker8k, MSCOCO and Flickr30k with proper hardware support.

Dependencies:

Python (>=3.6)
Deep learning framework (TensorFlow)
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV (for image processing), NLTK (for text preprocessing)
Usage:
Please refer to the provided documentation and Jupyter notebooks for detailed instructions on how to train the model, generate captions for images, and evaluate the results.
