# Image-Captioning-with-CNN-LSTM-Model
This repository contains an implementation of an image captioning system using a CNN-LSTM model. The system generates descriptive captions for input images, combining visual features extracted by a pre-trained CNN (such as VGG16) with textual features modeled by an LSTM network
