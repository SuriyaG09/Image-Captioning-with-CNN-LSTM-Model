        <p>
            The Image Captioning Website is a platform that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images using
            deep learning techniques. It utilizes a pre-trained model architecture to analyze and understand the content
            of images, enabling it to generate accurate and meaningful captions.

            <strong>Features:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upload images and get descriptive captions for them</li>
            <li>Intuitive and user-friendly interface</li>
            <li>Accurate and contextually relevant captions</li>
            <li>Supports a wide range of image formats</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Model Architecture:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The image captioning model is built using a deep learning architecture that combines a convolutional neural
            network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The CNN, specifically the VGG16 model, is used to extract
            rich and meaningful features from the input image. These features are then fed into the RNN, which generates
            the textual description or caption for the image.
